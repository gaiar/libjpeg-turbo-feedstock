#
# This is a no clobbing, symbols prefixed variant of
# conda-forge's libjpeg-turbo recipe. Changes:
#
#  - Linux only.
#
#  - Exported libjpeg symbols are prefixed with "turbo_".
#    This is easier to maintain than full-code patches.
#
#  - Header files are modified accordingly.
#    While keeping full compatibility with downstream
#    code, the new prefixed symbol names are aliased
#    to the new symbol names.
#
#  - These live in a custom location:
#      $PREFIX/lib/libjpeg-turbo/prefixed
#    Note that now libjpeg.h is a symlink to a new
#    file turbojpeglib.h; we recommend to use the new
#    name when possible, to avoid risking using
#    jpeg 9 equivalent due to include directories
#    ordering.
#
# You can find a usage example in our opencv recipe:
#   https://github.com/loopbio/opencv-feedstock
# Essentially:
#   1- Depend on this package
#    In meta.yaml files:
#      - libjpeg-turbo 1.5.90 noclob_prefixed
#    In match specs:
#      - libjpeg-turbo=1.5.90=noclob_prefixed
#
#   2- Configure downstream libraries to find
#      these artifacts. For example, opencv cmake:
#      -DJPEG_INCLUDE_DIR=${PREFIX}/lib/libjpeg-turbo/prefixed/include
#      -DJPEG_LIBRARY=${PREFIX}/lib/libjpeg-turbo/prefixed/lib/libturbojpeg.a
#
#   3- Optional but recommended: ensure we use the new
#      symbols by modifying includes in downstream libraries
#      and/or ensuring the included headers in the package
#      take precedence over system ones.
#
# Motivation
# ----------
#
# Conda-forge stack is built against the libjpeg 9.
# Libjpeg-turbo is purposely stuck at libjpeg 8 ABI:
#   https://libjpeg-turbo.org/About/Jpeg-9
#
# Unless we would build a whole parallel stack of packages
# against libjpeg-turbo (tiff, jasper, QT, opencv...),
# libjpeg-turbo cannot be a drop-in replacement or even
# the main jpeg implementation for conda environments.
# This is in contrast to, for example, many linux distros,
# where libjpeg-turbo is a first-class citizen. There are
# two main problems that arise when mixing jpeg 9 and
# libjpeg-turbo:
#
#  - Files clobbering. Alghough ABI versions avoid
#    full clobbering for DSOs, other files like "libjpeg.so",
#    "libjpeg.a" or "libjpeg.h" do get overwritten by
#    either package. This is dangerous when building
#    downstream libraries whose dependencies do pull
#    libjpeg.
#
#  - Symbols collision. These two libs are both designed
#    to have the same ABI yet have diverged on implementation.
#    Quite the segfault headache at runtime when not mixed
#    with care, specially if downstream dependencies are
#    chatty and re-export the symbols, as opencv does
#    by default. A quick summarizing read:
#    http://www.fcollyer.com/2013/01/04/elf-symbol-visibility-and-the-perils-of-name-clashing/
#
#  Conda build & compilers note
#  ----------------------------
#  This is our first guinea pig package built with (almost released)
#  conda-smithy 3 and conda build 3.
#
#  It is also ready to be compiled with the new anaconda compilers.
#  But note:
#    - the compilers package sets CFLAGS & friends (e.g.
#      mtune march...) to the values used by the whole anaconda
#      stack. We might not want these exact compilation & linking flags
#
#    - more importantly, incompatibilities  happen with downstream deps
#      e.g. opencv if built with older compilers.
#
#  So we comment using these new compilers out in this build, until we
#  adapt also the opencv recipe. For an example on how that adaptation
#  would look like, see:
#    https://github.com/AnacondaRecipes/opencv-feedstock
#

  summary: |
    IJG JPEG compliant runtime library with SIMD and other optimizations
    Can be mixed with libjpeg >= 9:
      - Library files live in custom locations
      - Public symbols are prefixed with "turbo_"
      - Provided headers allow to keep using standard libjpeg API
